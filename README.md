ABSTRACT

The purpose of this study is to examine the association between the different institutional settings of Teachers' Retirement Systems and the extent of teacher shortage at the level of pension plans. The mentions of “Teacher Shortage” have been prevalent over the media and once again reached the peak level within the cyclical pattern according to the data from NewsBank (Dee & Goldhaber, 2016). Furthermore, teachers’ dissatisfaction towards their low compensation package has led to recent waves of teacher walkouts and strikes nationwide. According to one of the Teacher Follow-up surveys conducted by National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), retaining retirement benefits is listed and ranked the very first among the factors that can bring teachers back (Sutcher etc., 2016). Given the fact that retirement system is very important in affecting teachers’ decisions, exploring and examining the relationship between the current teacher shortage and teacher’s retirement system is urgent and highly desirable. 

            There has been a growing number of empirical studies and reports focusing on the urgent teacher shortage issues (Ingersoll & Smith, 2003; Cochran-Smith, 2004; Ingersoll & May, 2011). However, research thoroughly addressing the association between different institutional settings of retirement systems and the teacher shortage is scarce. To fill this void, this study examines, to what extent the settings of retirement systems are associated with the teacher shortage at the level of pension plans. Data and Research Methods: to construct a panel data of pension plans and plan-level school staffing, I used Public Plans Database (2001 to 2015) from the Center for Retirement Research’s to merge with the district-level Common Core of Data about public school universe survey (2000/2001 to 2015/2016) from NCES. In order to examine the relationship between retirement systems and teacher shortage, I will use fixed (Plan& State) effects and random effects model to test, holding other conditions constant, whether different institutional settings (employee contribution rate, vesting periods, generational fairness etc.) are associated with teacher shortage (measured by student-teacher ratio) at the level of pension plans. The primary hypothesis is that the more generous and fair pension plans are, the teacher shortage could be less severe and vice versa. 

This study not only addresses the urgent issue of teacher shortage but also contributes to the extant literature of public pension management in three key ways. First, it timely reviews the very original function of the retirement systems in the important section of public education, recruiting and retaining workforces. Second, this empirical study examines the important topic utilizing plan-level data, which strengthens the credibility of research findings. Third, the findings can provide potential policy recommendations for researchers/state government officials who are considering to resolve teacher shortage through adjusting the institutional settings of the retirement systems.
